What is Node.js?

Answer:
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, built on Chrome’s V8 engine.

Deep Insight:

Browser JS → UI focused

Node.js → Server-side, file system, networking

Why Node is fast?

V8 compiles JS to machine code

Non-blocking I/O

2️⃣ Is Node.js a programming language?

❌ No

Explanation:
Node.js is:

❌ Not a language

✅ A runtime

✅ Uses JavaScript

Think of Node.js like:

JavaScript + Superpowers (FS, HTTP, OS access)

3️⃣ Why is Node.js single-threaded?

Node.js uses one main thread to handle requests.

Why this is good?

No thread switching overhead

Less memory usage

Faster I/O handling

Interview Trap:
👉 Node.js is single-threaded but NOT single-core

4️⃣ How does Node.js handle multiple requests?

Using:

Event Loop

Callback Queue

Async I/O

It doesn’t wait for one request to finish before starting another.

5️⃣ What is non-blocking I/O?

Blocking:

readFileSync()


→ waits until file read completes

Non-blocking:

readFile()


→ continues execution, callback runs later

This is the heart of Node.js performance

6️⃣ What is the Event Loop?

The Event Loop is a scheduler that decides:

Which callback executes next

When async code runs

Key Role:
It allows Node.js to behave asynchronously.

7️⃣ Explain Event Loop phases

Order of execution:

Timers (setTimeout)

I/O callbacks

Idle, prepare

Poll

Check (setImmediate)

Close callbacks

5️⃣1️⃣ Explain Node.js Event Loop in simple words

Answer:
The Event Loop is a mechanism that allows Node.js to:

Execute non-blocking operations

Handle thousands of requests with one thread

Analogy:
🧑‍🍳 One chef (single thread)
📋 Orders queue (callbacks)
⏳ Chef keeps checking which order is ready

5️⃣2️⃣ Why Event Loop is needed?

Because:

JavaScript is single-threaded

Blocking operations would freeze the server

Event Loop ensures:
✔ High performance
✔ Async execution

5️⃣3️⃣ What happens when an async function is called?

Request goes to Web APIs / libuv

Execution continues

Callback added to queue

Event Loop picks it when stack is empty

5️⃣4️⃣ What are the Event Loop phases (in order)?

Timers → setTimeout, setInterval

I/O callbacks

Idle, prepare

Poll (most important)

Check → setImmediate

Close callbacks
